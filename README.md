# iosdbg

An iOS debugger I'm making for my own sake of learning more about these devices. I don't know if this supports your device but you're welcome to try and compile it.

Clone this repository to your iOS device and run `make`.

This tool uses limenoise from https://github.com/antirez/linenoise as a readline alternative.
