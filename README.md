An iOS debugger I'm making for my own sake of learning more about these devices. I don't know if this supports your device but you're welcome to try and compile it.

Clone this repository to your iOS device and run `make`.

After compiling, be sure to sign it with the task-for-pid entitlement.

I'm new to Github so ignore all the commits that seem to be the result of me trying things until they work.

iosdbg uses linenoise from https://github.com/antirez/linenoise as a readline alternative.
