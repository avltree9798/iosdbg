An iOS debugger I'm making for my own sake of learning more about these devices. I don't know if this supports your device but you're welcome to try and compile it.

Compile readline for aarch64-apple-darwin and link with the readline library and ncurses.

After compiling, be sure to sign it with the task-for-pid entitlement.
